Make cake: Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease a 12-cup bundt pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla and almond extracts and mix until combined.
In another large bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.  Add half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, beating until just combined. Pour in milk and mix until fully incorporated, then add remaining dry ingredients and stir until just combined. 
Pour batter into greased bundt pan and smooth top with a rubber spatula. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack to cool completely. 
Make glaze: Whisk together powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and salt. Pour over cake and serve.
